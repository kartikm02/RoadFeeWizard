                                Toll gates exist in India to collect fees for the construction and maintenance of toll roads, highways, etc. These fees help fund the infrastructure, and toll gates serve as collection points for toll taxes.

                                While tolls are not entirely free for local residents, those living within a 20 km radius of toll plazas on national highways may be eligible for discounted rates[2]. TollGuru Toll API provides detailed information on local resident toll rates.

                                FASTag is mandatory for all vehicles in India. If you travel without a FASTag on National Highways, you’ll have to pay double the toll fees. The Indian government is pushing towards making it mandatory across all the highways[3].

                                The amount of toll is determined based on the length of the stretch of toll road (usually 60 km). If this is less, you will be charged based on the actual length of the road. Other factors are infrastructure type (bridge, tunnel, bypass, etc.) and also the vehicle’s axle count, load, etc. You can calculate the toll for your trip across India using TollGuru Toll Calculator.

                                No, it is a myth that when waiting time exceeds 3 minutes on Indian toll plaza lanes, the toll will be exempted. However, if the length of the queue exceeds 100 m from the toll plaza, the driver will not have to pay the toll[4].
